rem makes the process DPI-AWARE. Without it Windows reports 96 DPI whatever the user's scaling
rem is and bitmap-stretches the window -- which silently invalidates every geometry assertion
rem measured in this control, all of which derive from a scaled font. It also pulls in
rem Common-Controls v6, which the RichEdit inside PsTextBox expects.
